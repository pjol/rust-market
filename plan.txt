PLAN

pull, parse, and aggregate market data from coinmarketcap
 create iterator for date ranges ✅
 add query argument primitives ✅
 set up environment variables ✅
 implement api call builder
 add response object primitives & parser
 implement json saver & retriever (go both ways from json to response primitives)
 for now, just save and load json documents (eventually full db implementation?)

create market visualizer based on epoch ticks
 each tick should allow for variable
  - color
  - height
 and display options should include
  - tick duration (time which one tick represents)

create tick rendering modes
 control color based on variables
  - liquidation per X leverage, Y time to close, Z direction
  - liquidation per X leverage, Y margin to close, Z direction
